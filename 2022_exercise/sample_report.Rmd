## Purpose

This yearly report, provided to the Office of Safe Streets (OSS), will provide summary statistics relating to municipal-level crash data for the region.

## Limitations

Many shortcuts were taken! For example, crash data per capita was computed using 2015 'forecasts' as opposed to actual population data for the given crash year. The purpose of this exercise was to demonstrate a partial deliverable and illustrate future opportunities for improvement, etc. without strict regard for data accuracy or any sort of in-depth analysis. Because data was retrieved from DVRPC's data catalog, it is assumed that most, if not all of the data, has already been thoroughly screened and vetted before being publicly released.
